# Words-and-Character-Counter-B
I have created a Words and Character counter through Html, CSS and Javascript.
This is totally responsive website and easy to code for beginners.
I didn't use any third party tool for help.
# WORDS
In words you can see there's not "Counting" if you add "Space" at the start or end of the text.
Also no included "Characters" if you add "Space" between 2 texts.
# Characters
In characters evverything is easily to count by sequence and it is very responsive!
